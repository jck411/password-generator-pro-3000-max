        description: 'Pick a place you know well (living room, commute). 1) Choose a fixed route with clear stops (door → couch → TV → fridge). 2) Peg each password element by visualizing objects on top of, under, or hanging from each stop. 3) Recall by walking the route in your mind and reading off each peg. Method of loci performs very well for ordered recall. (Source: Psychnet)'

Research shows aerobic exercise ~4 hours after learning improves memory vs. immediate exercise (van Dongen et al., 2016). Caffeine taken after studying also enhanced 24-hour recall (Borota et al., 2014). Disclaimer: Caffeine is a study buddy. Meth is a life-choices boss fight. Choose accordingly.'
